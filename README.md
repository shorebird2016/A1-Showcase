# my-showcase-A1

This project was created to 
    (1) Organize collection of small AngularJS (A1) projects into one app for showcasing.
    (2) With the help of a special pane, user can view code associated with each project to quickly copy code.
A separate app will be created for Angular (A4) projects.
